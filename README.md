# DENGEN TOKEN(ERC20 TOKEN)

We did create the ERC 20 TOKEN and we did name it as "Dengen Game Token"

## Description

This smart contract is designed to illustrate various essential features of Solidity, including:

1.Minting new tokens: The platform is able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner has rights to mint tokens.
2.Transferring tokens: Players are able to transfer their tokens to others.
3.Redeeming tokens: Players are able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
4.Checking token balance: Players are able to check their token balance at any time.
5.Burning tokens: Anyone is able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.
The contract includes:

Functions to mint and burn tokens.
1.A function to safely perform all the operations.
2.Owner-restricted functions.
3.A function to add items in inventory.
4.Custom error handling.

## Getting Started

### Installing

This program runs on EVM along with ".sol" as extension. We can either run it on websites like Remix or even on Visual Studios.

### Executing program

We need a solidity compatible virtual machine in order to run this program. Create a new file with ".sol" extension

## Help

Common Issues:

Contract Compilation Errors: A. Ensure your Solidity version is compatible (0.8.18 or later). B. Check for syntax errors or typos in the contract.

Function Call Errors:

A. Ensure you are using the correct contract address and bridging of meta mask. B. Check for access restrictions if encountering permission errors (e.g., onlyowner functions).
